Reflective Analysis: 
This map was designed for users exploring public art locations in Vancouver. It caters to the needs of individuals seeking information about public art pieces, including location, details about artists, installation years, and project statements. Additional information about each art installation is available in a hyperlink at the bottom of each popup blurb, under ‘More details’, including photos of the art. The user experience is centered around ease of navigation and obtaining comprehensive information about each art location. 

Drawing inspiration from Muehlenhaus’ principle that "Less Color Variation Is More Powerful" and Jones’ advocacy for “Simplicity from Sacrifice,” the foundation of my map style was crafted in Mapbox Studio, utilizing the 'monochrome' greyscale style as a starting point. The intent was to create a design that harmoniously integrates relevant situational data while ensuring that the primary focus remains on the public art locations, aligning with principles from Jones (2010). In this user-centric design, the base map employs muted, neutral colors representing waterways (blue-grey) and green spaces (green-grey). The intentional use of these colors aims to provide a subtle backdrop, allowing the public art data layer to stand out prominently. Jones’ emphasis on avoiding clutter is observed, ensuring that only elements contributing to the user’s understanding are retained (Jones, 2010). The chosen muted colors for the base map layers complement each other, creating a subtle depth effect that recedes into the background. To maintain clarity, relevant labels such as road names and parks are strategically highlighted, aligning with the principles of visual hierarchy (Jones, 2010). This approach ensures readability for users seeking to locate specific art pieces. In line with Muehlenhaus’ recommendation of using “complementary colors,” clusters of public art locations are represented in saturated shades of red/pink, blue, and yellow. This deliberate choice adheres to the principles of color theory and serves a practical purpose. The complementary color scheme increases the overall saturation of the art location circles, heightening the contrast against the base map layer and drawing the user’s attention to these focal points (Muehlenhaus, 2014).

The goal was to create a visually appealing and intellectually engaging map that balances simplicity with effectiveness. The design aimed for a user-centric approach, making public art locations easily discernible while providing additional context through waterways, green spaces, and relevant road and place labels. Achieving a harmonious integration of elements, the map aims to guide users intuitively while offering a visually pleasing experience. The map incorporates dynamic features for different zoom levels. Clustering is employed to prevent overcrowding at lower zoom levels, and as users zoom in, clusters disband, revealing individual art locations. Additionally, the icon size for individual art locations dynamically adjusts with the zoom level, ensuring a balanced and informative display as users navigate through different zoom levels. There is much room for improvement and numerous things I attempted to implement in my map that I struggled with and eventually had to pivot to other ideas. For example, in the current iteration of my map, names in the popup boxes are displayed as [“Artist Name”], here I wanted to remove the square brackets and quotations, however, every method I attempted led to the code failing to run or made the popup box not work anymore. Additionally, the popup box contains a “More details” link. The only reason this link exists is because I wanted to insert a photo of each art piece within the popup box, but the format of the photo URL located within the GEOjson file meant that I could not pull it directly, and was thus unable to figure it out. To get around this issue, I decided to include a link to the artwork where users can see photos of the art as well as other information they may be interested in. The last thing I was keen on adding is a “selected” function that would store the ObjectID for the art piece that has most recently been clicked and thus is now showing its relevant popup information. This “selected” object would then have an icon that is a different color than the icon for unselected objects (white for unselected and yellow for selected).
